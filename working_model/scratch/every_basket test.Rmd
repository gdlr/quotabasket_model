### This is okay but it kinda sucks...



### Preparing the inputs and outputs for `qb_stock.r`:

For each species, we need:

* r - growth rate
* K - carrying capacity
* X - starting stock
* p - price

For each technology we need:

* Catchability per species
* Cost per unit effort

# Inputs

## Step 1: Input parameters
```{r}
# Species:
# s = species, r, K, X, p

s1 <- c(s=1, r=0.15, K=100, X=50, p=10) 
s2 <- c(s=2, r=0.2, K=100, X=50, p=20)
s3 <- c(s=3, r=0.2, K=100, X=50, p=8)
s4 <- c(s=4, r=0.3, K=100, X=50, p=10)
s5 <- c(s=5, r=0.4, K=100, X=50, p=12)

# t = tech, q1 = catchability species 1, q2 = catchability species 2...

t1 <- c(t=1, q1=0.04, q2=0.01, q3=0.01, q4=0.01, q5 = 0.1)
t2 <- c(t=2, q1=0.01, q2=0.04, q3=0.01, q4=0.01, q5 = 0.01)
t3 <- c(t=2, q1=0.01, q2=0.01, q3=0.04, q4=0.01, q5 = 0.01)
t4 <- c(t=2, q1=0.01, q2=0.01, q3=0.01, q4=0.04, q5 = 0.01)
t5 <- c(t=2, q1=0.01, q2=0.01, q3=0.01, q4=0.01, q5 = 0.04)

# Tech cost: t = tech, cost = cost per unit effort
c1 <- c(t=1, cost=1)
c2 <- c(t=2, cost=1)
c3 <- c(t=3, cost=1)
c4 <- c(t=4, cost=1)
c5 <- c(t=5, cost=1)

# Baskets: bimary matrix of # species x # baskets, where 1 means that species is in that basket

# b1 <- c(s1 = 1, s2 = 0, s3 = 0, s4 = 0, s5 = 0)
# b2 <- c(s1 = 0, s2 = 1, s3 = 0, s4 = 0, s5 = 0)
# b3 <- c(s1 = 0, s2 = 0, s3 = 1, s4 = 0, s5 = 0)
# b4 <- c(s1 = 0, s2 = 0, s3 = 0, s4 = 1, s5 = 0)
# b5 <- c(s1 = 0, s2 = 0, s3 = 0, s4 = 0, s5 = 1)


# Quotas: position = basket, number is the harvest limit.
# We want this to be 0.1 of the preceding stock under constant mortality, so this will have to change to just input constant m.

mort_guess = c(0.2, 0.2)

# Years
years = 30
```

# Step 2: make a list of the inputs
```{r}
# Change these to reflect the number of species and technologies above:
species = list(s1, s2, s3, s4, s5)
tech = list(t1, t2, t3, t4, t5)
cost = list(c1, c2, c3, c4, c5)
# baskets = list(b1, b2, b3, b4, b5)
```

```{r}
source(here("working_model", "functions", "every_basket.R"))
```


# Run this!
```{r}
output <- every_basket(species, tech, cost, n_baskets = 2, mort_guess, years, cores = 1)

output$profits
output$biomass
output$baskets

biomass <- output$biomass %>% 
  mutate(basket = seq(1, nrow(output$biomass))) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4, s_5),
               values_to = "biomass",
               names_to = "species")

profits <- output$profits %>% 
  mutate(basket = seq(1, nrow(output$biomass)))
