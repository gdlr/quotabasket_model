Ecology,Trophic level,Ecosystem representation,Hard to measure,-
-,-,potential for increased productivity,Hard to enforce,-
-,-,-,Hard to understand,-
-,Size,Protect important life stages,Targeting of juveniles,Minimum length
-,-,Easy to measure and enforce,Demographic instability,Minimum mesh
-,-,Represents some fishing dynamics (mesh sizes),-,Maximum length
-,Functional Group,Maintains ecoststem balance,Information intensive,-
-,-,Fishing similar to status quo,"Hard to manage, understand",-
-,Status,Protects overexploited species,Need some stock knowledge,-
-,-,Does not require a full stock assessment,High impact to status quo fishing,-
-,Growth Rate,Indicator of explotability,Need some knowledge,-
-,-,-,Wrong estimates lead to poor outcomes,-
-,Life History,Incorporates species susceptibility,Information intensive,-
-,-,Closer to optimal yeild?,Hard to understand,-
-,-,Reduces risk of overfishing,Poor information leads to unintended outcomes,-
Market,Price,Protects high value species,Limits revenues,-
-,-,Causes diversification,May affect certain fishers more than others,-
-,Market groupings,Market may have grouped similar species,May cause some species to collapse,-
-,-,"Simple, understandable management units",-,-
-,-,Species often caught together,-,-
-,Costs,Can manipulate targeting decisions,Hard to determine targeting costs,-
-,-,-,Alternative technologies exist,-
Fisher's behavior,Territory,Exclusive rights to fish,Fish are migratory,TURF's
-,-,Empower local communities,Not flexible if certain areas are degraded,-
-,-,Create protected or low-take areas,High enforcement costs,-
-,-,,High social information requirements,-
-,Time,"Low monitoring, enforcement costs","""Race to fish"" when season is open",China's summer moratorium
-,-,"Many species, simple quota",Some fish are more susceptible in season than others,Fishery seasons
-,-,Effort limits lead to harvest reductions,-,-
-,Fishing gear,Align baskets with fishing practices,"Encourages ""highgrading"", does not represent market",-
-,-,"Bycatch is a target species, counts against main quota",High exit costs if quota is hit too soon,-
-,-,-,May force technology transition,-
-,Risk,Maximize returns,High information cost,Portfolio theory
-,-,"Reduce variability in stocks, profits",Hard to communicate,-
