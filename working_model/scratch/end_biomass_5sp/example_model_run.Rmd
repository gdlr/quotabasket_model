### Preparing the inputs and outputs for `qb_stock.r`:

For each species, we need:

* r - growth rate
* K - carrying capacity
* X - starting stock
* p - price

For each technology we need:

* Catchability per species
* Cost per unit effort

# Inputs

## Step 1: Input parameters
```{r}
# Species:
# s = species, r, K, X, p

s1 <- c(s=1, r=0.15, K=100, X=50, p=10) 
s2 <- c(s=2, r=0.2, K=100, X=50, p=20)
s3 <- c(s=3, r=0.2, K=100, X=50, p=8)
s4 <- c(s=4, r=0.3, K=100, X=50, p=10)
s5 <- c(s=5, r=0.4, K=100, X=50, p=12)

# t = tech, q1 = catchability species 1, q2 = catchability species 2...

t1 <- c(t=1, q1=0.04, q2=0.01, q3=0.01, q4=0.01, q5 = 0.1)
t2 <- c(t=2, q1=0.01, q2=0.04, q3=0.01, q4=0.01, q5 = 0.01)
t3 <- c(t=2, q1=0.01, q2=0.01, q3=0.04, q4=0.01, q5 = 0.01)
t4 <- c(t=2, q1=0.01, q2=0.01, q3=0.01, q4=0.04, q5 = 0.01)
t5 <- c(t=2, q1=0.01, q2=0.01, q3=0.01, q4=0.01, q5 = 0.04)

# Tech cost: t = tech, cost = cost per unit effort
c1 <- c(t=1, cost=1)
c2 <- c(t=2, cost=1)
c3 <- c(t=3, cost=1)
c4 <- c(t=4, cost=1)
c5 <- c(t=5, cost=1)

# Baskets: bimary matrix of # species x # baskets, where 1 means that species is in that basket

b1 <- c(s1 = 1, s2 = 0, s3 = 0, s4 = 0, s5 = 0)
b2 <- c(s1 = 0, s2 = 1, s3 = 0, s4 = 0, s5 = 0)
b3 <- c(s1 = 0, s2 = 0, s3 = 1, s4 = 0, s5 = 0)
b4 <- c(s1 = 0, s2 = 0, s3 = 0, s4 = 1, s5 = 0)
b5 <- c(s1 = 0, s2 = 0, s3 = 0, s4 = 0, s5 = 1)


# Quotas: position = basket, number is the harvest limit.
# We want this to be 0.1 of the preceding stock under constant mortality, so this will have to change to just input constant m.

mort_guess = c(0.2, 0.2)

# Years
years = 30
```

# Step 2: make a list of the inputs
```{r}
# Change these to reflect the number of species and technologies above:
species = list(s1, s2, s3, s4, s5)
tech = list(t1, t2, c3, c4, c5)
cost = list(c1, c2, c3, c4, c5)
baskets = list(b1, b2, b3, b4, b5)
```

# Step 3: Run the function

```{r}
source(here("working_model", "functions", "optimal_baskets.R"))

output <- optimal_baskets(species, tech, cost, baskets, mort_guess, years)
```


```{r}
